        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
            Eating a well-balanced diet is crucial for maintaining good health and well-being. Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats in your daily meals. Drink plenty of water and avoid excessive sugar, salt and unhealthy fats.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>
            Regular physical activity is essential for overall health and fitness. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Mental Health</h2>
        <p>
            Taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. Practice stress management techniques, such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. Make time for hobbies and activities that bring you joy and maintain strong connections with friends and family.
